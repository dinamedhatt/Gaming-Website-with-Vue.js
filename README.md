# TPAY Mobile Task

## Project Description
The project is a game website, where user can see recommended, featured and popular games, and check the whole info for each game. It fetches data from fake API. It's created with Vue.js version 3. Also I used Zeplin to export the XD design on it to check the fonts and colors needed.
